# Installation
if you want a static version of roblokis the follow below

**NOTE:** the extension only works on chromium based browsers
so browsers like firefox isn't supported

Side Notes:
-- using it like that won't get you updates, you will have to redo this every time the extension gets updated
-- you might get an annoy popup every time you open the browser

### Steps:
1. Download the roblokis folder and exctract the file (if archived)
(location doesn't matter)
2. go to your Browser's extension tab a.k.a. Extension Manager
3. turn on Developer Mode
4. click "Load Unpacked"
5. select the extension files
6. have fun using it :D
